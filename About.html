                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hi, I’m Stephen Mathew Buencuchillo, a passionate photographer with a love for capturing the thrill of sports and the beauty of automotive design. Based in Bacolod City, Philippines, I’ve spent years honing my craft, combining technical expertise with a creative eye to deliver dynamic and visually compelling images.</p>
                <p>With a background in shooting for local sports clubs and working with automotive enthusiasts, I specialize in high-energy, action-packed shots as well as elegant, static compositions. My journey behind the lens has been driven by a fascination with motion, precision, engineering, and the stories that unfold in every frame.</p>
                <p>Whether I’m shooting the fast-paced action of a game or the sleek lines of a classic car, my goal is always the same: to create images that speak to the viewer, evoking emotion and telling a story through every shot.</p>
                <p>When I’m not behind the camera, I’m often working on expanding my portfolio and refining my web presence to share my work with a broader audience.</p>
